# Changelog

## 2.0.0-dev.5

- __Breaking__: Renamed `TransactionReceipt.fromJson` to `TransactionReceipt.fromMap`

## 2.0.0-dev.4

- __Breaking__: Removed the `backgroundIsolate` option from `Web3Client`. 
  For background isolates, instead use `runner: await IsolateRunner.spawn()` from `package:isolate`.
- __Breaking__: Changed `TransactionInformation.r` and `TransactionInformation.s` from `Uint8List` to
  `BigInt`
- Add `ecRecover` and `isValidSignature` to verify messages. Thanks, [brickpop](https://github.com/brickpop)!
- Add `compressPublicKey` and `decompressPublicKey` to obtain a compressed or expanded version of keys.
- Add `getLogs` method to `Web3Client`. Thanks, [jmank88](https://github.com/jmank88)!
- Fix `hexToDartInt` not actually parsing hex ([#81](https://github.com/simolus3/web3dart/issues/81))

## 1.2.3

- include a `0x` for hex data in `eth_estimateGas` - thanks, [@Botary](https://github.com/Botary)

## 1.2.2
- Fixed a bug when decoding negative integers ([#73](https://github.com/simolus3/web3dart/issues/73))

## 1.2.0
- Added `estimateGas` method on `Web3Client` to estimate the amount of gas that
  would be used by a transaction.
  
In 1.2.1, the `atBlock` parameter on `estimateGas` was deprecated and will be ignored.

## 1.1.1, 1.1.1+1
- Fix parsing transaction receipts when the block number is not yet available.
Thanks to [@chart21](https://github.com/chart21) for the fix.
- Fix a typo that made it impossible to load the coinbase address. Thanks to
[@modulovalue](https://github.com/modulovalue) for the fix.

## 1.1.0
- Added `getTransactionReceipt` to get more detailed information about a
transaction, including whether it was executed successfully or not.

## 1.0.0
Basically a complete rewrite of the library - countless bug fixes, a more fluent
and consistent api and more features:
- experimental api to perform expensive operations in a background isolate. Set
`enableBackgroundIsolate` to true when creating a `Web3Client` to try it out.
- Events! Use `addedBlocks`, `pendingTransactions` and `events` for auto-updating
streams.
- The client now has a `dispose()` method which should be called to stop the 
background isolate and terminate all running streams.

This version contains breaking changes! Here is an overview listing some of them.

| Before        | Updated API  |
| :------------- | -----:|
| Creating credentials via `Credentials.fromPrivateKeyHex`   | Use the `EthPrivateKey` class or, even better, `client.credentialsFromPrivateKey` |
| Sending transactions or calling contract functions | The api has been changed to just a single methods instead of a transaction builder. See the examples for details. |
| Low-level cryptographic operations like signing, hashing and converting hex <-> byte array <-> integer  | Not available in the core library. Import `package:web3dart/crypto.dart` instead |
